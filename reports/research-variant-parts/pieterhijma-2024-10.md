## Summary of Activities - Research Variant Parts - October 2024

The work in October is mostly starting up and focuses on presenting the
research in forum posts to users and developers.

I created the [forum topic Variant
Parts](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=91325) in Users -> Open
Discussion.  This topic is directed at users and developers and aims to provide
the community with an understanding of what FreeCAD currently has for variants
and what I'm going to research.

On the current situation regarding variants, I created four videos each
explaining a mechanism that users can apply:
- Part 1: Copies
- Part 2: Copy-on-change links
- Part 1: Tracking copy-on-change links
- Part 1: Subshapebinders

I also posted a video "Variants in FreeCAD: An Interface for Geometry" that
discusses the potential of leveraging FreeCAD's property system for expressing
design intent, how this can currently be done in FreeCAD with hidden references
and the drawbacks and relation to cyclic dependencies.

I also started the [forum topic Variant
Parts](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=91537) in the developer's
corner that is directed to developers.

Additionally, I created a [channel Variant
Parts](https://discord.com/channels/870877411049357352/1295647084485152768) now
moved to [this
location](https://discord.com/channels/870877411049357352/1298197289357021204).
I discussed there with Kartoffelp√ºre mainly how Solidworks implements variants.
