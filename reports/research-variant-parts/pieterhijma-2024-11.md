## Summary of Activities - Research Variant Parts - November 2024

This project did not have as much activity as expected in November, mostly due
to Ondsel shutting down.  It focuses on presenting the research in forum posts
to users and developers.

The activity was mostly discussing in [forum topic Variant
Parts](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?t=91325) and on
[Discord](https://discord.com/channels/870877411049357352/1298197289357021204)
a design with IPowIPi/Ferdinand.
