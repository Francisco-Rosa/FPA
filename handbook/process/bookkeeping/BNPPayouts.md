# BNP Payouts

The FPA has a bank account at BNP Paribas Fortis.  The account is accessible to 
designated members of the administrative team.

## Currency
The FPA BNP account is denominated in Euros (EUR).

## Bank Transfers
In order to pay someone via bank transfer, we need:
* payee name  (A. Contributor)
* bank name  (1st Bank of FreeCAD)
* account number (1234567890)
* bank identifier (BIC code. may have local name, ex IFSC Code in India)

Bank transfers within the EU have no associated fees.  Transfers outside the EU
may have fees at our (BNP) end and also at the payee's end.  

The FPA normally pays all related fees and the payee receives the full amount of
the payment.  This may require the payee to determine the local fees and advise 
the FPA.

## BNP and regulations
The FPA BNP account operates under Belgian/EU regulations which may impose limitations
on payment methods and destinations.
