# PayPal Payouts

PayPal is the easiest way to make payments for the FPA, but there are some things
to keep in mind.


## Currency
The FPA PayPal account has balances in two currencies: US dollars (USD) and EUROS (EUR).
PayPal freely moves money between the USD and EUR balances to cover pay out amounts.

Transfers may be made to accounts in other currencies, but exchange fees may be 
levied.


## Transfer Fees
Transfers between PayPal accounts are free.  Transfers from PayPal to our bank account
are also free.

PayPal collects a fee on each donation, but the amount of the fee can be difficult to 
predict.  The fees depend on the amount of the transaction and the Paypal "regions" 
involved.  A good estimate is 3.5% of the transaction amount plus 0.39 EUR.


## An Example

## PayPal and regulations
The FPA PayPal account operates under Belgian/EU regulations which may impose limitations
on payment methods and destinations.
