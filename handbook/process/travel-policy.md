# FPA Travel policy

The policies adopted by the FPA to fund travel

The FreeCAD Project Association supports travel of developers and community members to in-person events to further our goal of improving FreeCAD. Travel support is subject to the following limits and guidelines:  

1. The FPA sets a yearly maximum travel budget as part of its overall budgeting process, and total FPA-supported travel-related expenses cannot exceed that amount without a vote for additional appropriations. The budget is currently 15,000 USD per year.
2. Travel support is limited to two trips per year per traveler.
3. Standard support is capped to a maximum amount per trip (currently 600 USD per trip). Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis.
4. Support is not limited to FPA-sponsored events: any event where attendance benefits FreeCAD is eligible for support. Travel to non-FPA-sponsored events requires the traveler to explain how FreeCAD will benefit from their attendance at that event.
5. The FPA cannot sponsor visas for international travel, but it can write an invitation letter for FPA-sponsored events. Visa expenses may be included in the travel support request. If a visa is required for attendance, airfare and lodging should be refundable. If included in the request, the FPA understands that the visa expenses are non-refundable and will be covered even in the event that the visa is denied.
6. Travel support is provided as reimbursement based on receipts for actual expenses. If an advance is required it should be arranged by reaching out to the FPA at [fpa@freecad.org](mailto:fpa@freecad.org). The FPA does not pay a per diem rate.
7. To request travel support, please fill out the form at [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTV6so0nFJyxnxH6-HCv0q1_393UrK2Cxjdnzl8a-a5k7d9g/viewform?usp=sf_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTV6so0nFJyxnxH6-HCv0q1_393UrK2Cxjdnzl8a-a5k7d9g/viewform?usp=sf_link) at least thirty days in advance of the event.
8. Travel via train, bus, or other public transit is preferred over air travel when feasible.
9. All travel grants are subject to a vote of the FPA members, and no support is guaranteed until that vote is completed.](https://blog.freecad.org)
