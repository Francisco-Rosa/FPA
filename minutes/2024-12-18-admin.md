## FreeCAD Project Association Meeting Summary

18 December 2024

This meeting of the FreeCAD Project Association (FPA) focused on reviewing the organization's progress and planning for the upcoming year. The discussion covered a wide range of topics, including financial management, grant programs, developer initiatives, and future goals.

### Meeting Logistics and Holiday Break

The meeting began with a brief update on the participants' recent activities. The group then decided to cancel the meetings scheduled for December 25th and January 1st due to the holidays, resuming on January 7th or 8th.

### Donation Strategies and Fundraising

Reqrefusion, a participant, brought up the topic of donation strategies. He suggested that the FPA could be more proactive in soliciting donations, particularly given the recent release of FreeCAD 1.0. Yorik agreed that the FPA could be more aggressive in its fundraising efforts, but emphasized the need for a strategic approach, and disliked the use of the word "aggressive". He suggested that the FPA could focus on identifying specific areas where donations could be requested, rather than launching a full-blown campaign. Alex, another participant, agreed, suggesting that campaigns are most effective when they have clear goals and a roadmap. The group decided to revisit this topic in a couple of months, long enough after the release of FreeCAD 1.0 to assess the impact on donations and determine the best course of action.

### Grant Program Review and Future Plans

The meeting then moved on to a discussion of the FPA's grant program. Chris Hennes (@chennes) noted that the program had been successful in its first year, but questioned the value of the focused application period. Alex suggested that the program could be improved by giving applicants more time to respond and by increasing outreach efforts. The group also discussed the possibility of transitioning to a quarterly grant review process, rather than an annual one. This would allow for more efficient review and potentially provide a better understanding of the FPA's overall spending. chennes agreed to discuss this proposal with the grant review committee and to solicit feedback on the proposed changes.

### Developer Initiatives and Top Four Priorities

The meeting concluded with a review of the FPA's top four initiatives, which had been reorganized by chennes and Brad. The four areas identified were:

* **Improving FreeCAD's position within the larger free and open source software ecosystem:** This includes supporting third-party software development and fostering collaboration within the open source community.
* **Improving developer experience and effectiveness:** This involves initiatives such as mentoring new developers, improving documentation, and enhancing code quality.
* **Improving the user experience:** This includes addressing feature parity requests and ensuring that FreeCAD meets user expectations.
* **Standards compliance:** This involves ensuring that FreeCAD meets relevant industry standards and regulations.

The group agreed that these four areas provide a good framework for prioritizing future initiatives and for evaluating grant applications. They also discussed the possibility of publishing a roadmap for the upcoming year, which would include the top four initiatives and financial projections.

### Key Takeaways and Next Steps

The meeting concluded with a general consensus that the FPA is in a strong position, with a growing user base and a healthy financial outlook. The group identified several key areas for improvement, including:

* **Developing a more strategic approach to fundraising.**
* **Evaluating and potentially revising the grant program.**
* **Continuing to prioritize the top four initiatives.**
* **Publishing a roadmap for the upcoming year.**

The next meeting is scheduled for January 8th, and will focus on further discussion of these topics and on planning for the year ahead.
