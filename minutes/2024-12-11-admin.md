## FPA Meeting Summary

11 December 2024

This meeting of the FreeCAD Project Association (FPA) focused on reviewing grant proposals, discussing project priorities for the upcoming year, and planning for future events.

### Grant Review and Discussion

The meeting began with a discussion of a potential grant increase for Max Wilfinger, who is currently working on bug triage for FreeCAD. He has proposed increasing his monthly compensation from 500 euros to 1300 euros, which would make it the largest grant the FPA has funded. The attendees generally agreed that Max has been doing a great job and that the increased compensation is justified. chennes will put this up for an FPA General Assembly vote.

Next, the group discussed an email from Dr. Denilo Di Donato from a university in Italy regarding the Horizon program, an EU program focused on sustainability. Attendees were unsure of the university's intentions, whether they were seeking funding from the FPA or offering funding. The group decided to write back to Dr. Di Donato and request clarification. sliptonic will do this.

### Website Analytics and Privacy Concerns

The next agenda item was a proposal from Reqrefusion to implement various analytics tools on the FreeCAD website, including Google Analytics, Yandex Metrics, Open Web Analytics, and Google Search Console. reqrefusion argued for the benefits of these tools, highlighting their ability to track website traffic and user behavior. However, others raised concerns about privacy and the potential for data collection by Google. The group decided to postpone a decision on this proposal and instead discuss it further at a developer meeting, emphasizing the need to consider user privacy and the potential impact on the FreeCAD project's privacy policy.

### Long-Term Project Planning and Priorities

The meeting then shifted to a discussion of the FPA's long-term goals and priorities. The attendees discussed the originally-formed list and worked to move items around and form it into a smaller number of focus areas:

* **Improving FreeCAD's position within the larger ecosystem:** This includes fostering collaboration with other open-source projects, encouraging academic development, and promoting FreeCAD at events like Fosdem.
* **Improving the FreeCAD user experience:** This encompasses making the software more user-friendly, addressing usability issues, and improving the overall user experience.
* **Improving the FreeCAD developer experience:** This involves making it easier for developers to contribute to the project, providing better documentation and onboarding, and encouraging mentorship.
* **Improving the stability and predictability of the FreeCAD codebase:** This includes addressing code quality issues, implementing standards, and ensuring the long-term stability of the software.

The group discussed each item in detail, debating the relative importance of each area and whether they should be included in the top four priorities. They ultimately decided to remove several items from the list, including 3D rendering, performance, and specific features like the LTNP and hidden line removal. They also decided to add a new item focusing on standards compliance, recognizing the importance of adhering to industry standards for interoperability and compatibility.

### Upcoming Events and Actions

The meeting concluded with a discussion of upcoming events and actions, including:

* **Fosdem 2025:** chennes encouraged attendees to attend Fosdem and suggested reaching out to key developers and contributors to encourage their participation.
* **Grant applications:** chennes mentioned a new grant application from Jinky for the second part of the Sketchery refactoring.
* **Ongoing votes:** chennes reminded attendees of two votes closing later that day regarding the updated conflict of interest policies for the grant review committee and the FPA as a whole.
* **Discourse installation:** chennes acknowledged a request from reqrefusion to install Discourse as a Docker container and offered to help with the process.

The meeting ended with a reminder to revisit the list of top four priorities next week and to finalize the grant program for the upcoming year. sliptonic also suggested writing a blog post outlining the FPA's priorities and vision for the future, which would help align developers and users and reassure them that the FPA is focused on the right things.
